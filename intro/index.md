![Intro Ravnica](/img/intro-ravnica-1.jpg)

Ravnica je masivan plane-grad i radnja se odvija u 10om Districtu Ravnice, velikom chunku grada koji je u centru zbivanja. U gradu postoji 10 guildova gdje svaki ima svoju svrhu, želje i tajne.

Stanje u gradu postaje sve gore, vlada generalni nemir i tenzije između guildova postaju sve veće. Dolazi do sve više guild konflikata i sve više kriminala.

![Intro Ravnica 2](/img/intro-ravnica-2.jpg)

Tu dolaziš ti.

Zbog ovog ili onog razloga, završio/la si u Azorious zatvoru. Azorious je jedan od 10 guildova koji između ostalog ima ulogu policije. S obzirom da je kriminala sve više a Azorious policajaca nema dovoljno, Sarvis, glavni komisionar i šef policije Azoriousa, je upravo uveo novu inicijativu, inicijativu u kojoj ste vi pokusni kunići.

Azorious birokracija nije poznata po tome da su sažeti i službeni dokument koji opisuje ovaj novi zakon ima 250 stranica. No sažetak je ovakav:

"Sposobni zatvorenici će biti stavljni u squadove, biti u prilici riješiti se dijela kriminala u ovom gradu i usput zaraditi svoju slobodu. Dobit će niz zadataka, slučajeva koje treba riješiti. Ako uspješno riješe slučajeve i privedu zločince pravdi, bit će nagrađeni sa slobodom. Ako ne uspiju...spominje se naziv Suicide Squad. Takva je riječ zakona."

![New Phrav](/img/new-phrav.jpg)

Pod pratnjom ste odvedeni do Novog Phrava, Azorious guildhalla i tamo zajedno sjedite u sobi za ispitivanje i čekate briefing...

## Priprema linka

Lik u ovoj kampanji zahtijeva 2 dodatna dijela backstorya:
- Zašto je završio u zatvoru?
- Kojem guildu pripada?

Dodatni backstory elementi koji su korisni:
- Tko mu je doušnik / prijatelj u njegovom (ili drugom) guildu?
- Ima li neki (1 / 2) guilda koje posebno ne voli? Ima li neprijatelja u njemu?

### Azorious Senate

![](/img/azorious-knight-arbiter.jpg)

![](/img/azorious-lawmage.jpg)

"Iz kaosa stvoriti red", to je misija i svrha Azorious Senata. Bez desetki tisuća stranica pažljivo napisanog zakona, Ravnica bi pala u potpuno rasulo gdje bi Rakdos i Gruul radili što god žele. Azoriousi nose tešku odgovornost ne samo prema svojim članovima nego i prema svim stanovnicima grada. Oni izvršavaju poslove legislative, istrage zločina i izvršavanja zakona. Možda će proces trajati ali budite sigurni da će oni koji su krivi biti uhvaćeni i kažnjeni. "Takva je riječ zakona".

#### Guildmaster - Isperia

![](/img/azorious-isperia.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a member of the Azoriu s Senate, you are probably engaged in the work of law enforcement (even if your background involved the legislative or judicial aspects of the senate's activities). Legislative aides and judges' clerks find little reason to venture beyond the Azorius guildhalls. but soldiers and lawmages patrol the streets daily. An Azorius soldier or lawmage is a force for order, charged with fighting crime on the streets-and in the halIs of power. You might spend your time foiling thefts, putting a stop to Orzhov extortion, rooting out Dimir spies, or hunting down Golgari assassins. Perhaps you take your orders from a precognitive mage (or you are one yourself) who receives unpredictable and cryptic visions of future crimes that you and your allies must try to prevent.

### Boros Legion

![](/img/boros-guildmage.jpg)

![](/img/boros-master-warcraft.jpg)
Clad in shining armor and fueled by righteous zeal, the soldiers of the Boros Legion take up steel against the corruption and lawlessness that gnaw at the soul of Ravnica. Combining the force of law with the military strength to back it up, the Boros work to forge Ravnica into a just society, a safe and healthy community for all. From garrisons throughout the sprawling city, disciplined, stalwart soldiers are dispatched to stand firm against Gruul raids, Dimir infiltration, Golgari corruption, and the subtle influence of more nefarious foes.

The archangel Razia was the original guildmaster of the Boros Legion, which was established to serve as Ravnica's standing army. Razia served as its guildmaster for almost ten thousand years. Legend says that all the other angels of Ravnica were created in the image of this semidivine figure, and her death was devastating to the guild. Aurelia, the current angelic guildmaster, is the third to hold that title.

#### Guildmaster - Aurelia

![](/img/boros-aurelia.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a member of the Boros Legion, you are subject to the orders of your superior officers. You go where the angels tell you to go, and you do what they command you to do, to the best of your ability. If you enjoy some measure of independence, it's either because you have proven yourself capable of working without close supervision or because you're a rebellious sort who is willing to disobey orders now and face the consequences later.

As a soldier on the street, you are tasked with bringing dangerous threats like the Rakdos and the Gruul in line. You might contend with Rakdos performances gone horribly out of control, Gruul raids on outlying neighborhoods, shipments of rot-infested vegetation from the Golgari undercity, and violent uprisings among the guildless. At the same time, you might have to worry about Dimir spies infiltrating your leadership, overzealous or corrupt Azorius senators abusing the law at the expense of justice. Izzet experiments leveling city blocks, and Simic creations that break out of laboratories and wreak havoc through the Tenth District.

### House Dimir

![](/img/dimir-house-guildmage.jpg)

![](/img/dimir-deadly-visit.jpg)

House Dimir is Ravnica's dark secret: behind a facade of respectable messengers and reporters lurks an association of spies and assassins whose existence is barely suspected by the populace at large. Secrecy is both House Dimir's best weapon and its best defense, and much of the guild's work is hidden even from other members. Dimir agents leave no trace of their covert activities, warping the memories of witnesses to their crimes and even wiping their own minds to remove any evidence of their completed assignments.

The first guild master of House Dimir was a vampire named Szadek, whose organization agreed to serve as Ravnica's couriers, information brokers, and librarians. But Szadek also used his guild's expertise at gathering information to build a vast spy network, and before long, the secret operations of the guild vastly outweighed its overt ones. Eventually the guild disappeared into the shadows, and most Ravnicans came to doubt its existence. An immortal entity, Szadek ruled the guild for ten thousand years until he was arrested and killed.

#### Guildmaster - Lazav

![](/img/dimir-nightveil-predator.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a Dimir adventurer, you are a member of the guild's network of spies, thieves, assassins, and mind mages that lurks behind the facade of the public guild. On the surface, House Dimir presents the appearance of a network of couriers, investigators, media reporters, and archivists, dealing in information and spreading news. But you and your peers trade in secrets. You use secret symbols, runnes, and signals to covertly communicate with other Dimir agents, often in plain sight.

Like any good spy, you have multiple identities: your true face as an agent of House Dimir; a guildless identity; and a role as a member of another guild. Within that secondary guild, you might already be on a mission for House Dimir, assigned to spy on the guild, collect information about a person, or recruit another spy from the ranks of the guild. Or that guild could be a launching point for your real mission. Perhaps. for example, you were ordered to infiltrate the Azorius in hopes of gaining access to a notorious inmate in an Azorius prison.

### Golgari Swarm

![](/img/swarm-guildmage.jpg)

![](/img/golgari-2.jpg)

The teeming masses that compose th e Golgari Swarm see themselves as pragmatic above all else, uncowed by the simple fact that death is part of the cycle of life. They believe the idea of life and death as opposing forces to be nothing more than naive sentimentality. They know everything crumbles and rots in the end, and then new life springs from that rot. Time inevitably passes, bringing both destruction and new creation to all things. The original mandate of the Golgari Swarm under the leadership of Svogthir, its Devkarin founder, was to maintain Ravnica's agriculture and manage its waste. But Svogthir's interest in necromancy, and his eventual transformation into a lich, shaped the course of the guild's act ivities and gave birth to its philosophy of embracing death as part of nature's cycle.

#### Guildmaster - Vraska

![](/img/vraska-golgari-queen.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

As part of the Golgari Swarm, you are a specialized instrument of the greater body. Your orders, when you have such, come from the guild master by way of his chancellors who carry his messages throughout the guild. The swarm relies on you to advance the greater good by protecting some part, however small, of its teeming existence. That responsibility doesn't mean you're indispensable; your eventual death is part of your purpose and function too, and you·ll be replaced even as your body provides nutrients to further the swarm's growth.

A classic adventuring role for a member of the Golgari involves crawling through dungeon-like environments, the sewers and ancient vaults of the undercity in search of treasures left behind by the dead. Sometimes you might be sent to find a specific item believed lost in a dangerous part of the undercity. At other times, you could be asked to collect samples of a specific fungus, retrieve a body floating in the muck of the sewers, or bring back whatever booty you can to help fill the swarm's coffers.

You might gain enough renown to become a member of the Ochran, assigned to a variety of tasks concerning thievery, assassination, or the protection of important figures in your guild. You might steal something because the guild needs it, or because its loss will bring harm to another guild, hastening that group's decline.

### Gruul Clans

![](/img/gruul-nikaya.jpg)

![](/img/gruul-maiacal-rage.jpg)

The Gruul Clans are a wild people in a civilized land, a loose affiliation of bands that squat on the fringes of Ravnican society. They shun the centers of civilization. which they see as a source of oppression and weakness, and instead haunt Ravnica's alley ways, abandoned zones, and ruins. They want to see the edifice of civilization torn down so the world can revert to the pure wilderness that thrived before the city grew to cover everything. Then the true order of nature can be restored - an unbridled and brutal state in which only the strong survive and the strongest rule.

In a world covered with city streets and towering buildings, the Gruul are the most out of place. The most ill at ease, and the most eager to topple it all and start fresh. Constant ritualistic warfare reverberates among the clans, every skirmish reinforcing their doctrine of the survival of the fittest. They frequently send roaming bands into civilized areas to secure goods-and to wreak havoc.

The first leader of the Gruul was Cisarzim, a cyclops who was purportedly the ancestor of Borborygmos, the current guildmaster. Cisarzim was called the Lord of Chaos, and his guild's original function as maintainers of Ravnica's natural places meant keeping his faction as remote as possible from the civilized parts of the world. The gradual expansion of the city, however, has driven the Gruul into smaller and smaller refuges.

#### Guildmaster - Borborygmos ? Domri Rade ?

Borborygmos was Gruul's guildmaster for many centuries. However there is talk about a new kid on the block, a powerful young shaman who managed to unite all Gruul clans and defeat Borborygmos. These just might be rumors tho...

![](/img/gruul-borborygmos.jpg)
Borborygmos

![](/img/gruul-domri-rade.jpg)
Domri

#### How Do I Fit In?

In service of a simple goal, you have a simple part to play: Fight. Unleash your rage. Flatten buildings and defeat those who stand in your way. Be Gruul, in your own way.

You will frequently be summoned to participate in a raid your clan is launching against the city or against a group of its defenders. Your clan leader might also send you on a special mission, though it would almost certain ly still qualify as a raid. You might join a small group of Gruu 1 warriors on a dangerous charge deep into the settled streets to plunder a certain location, retrieve an item stolen from your clan, or assault a Boros garrison. Sometimes your objective might be more esoteric.

With prophecies of the return of llharg the Raze-Boar spreading like wildfire among the Gruul druids, you might be asked to carry out some task that the druids believe will speed his coming. Such a task might involve collecting a sacred relic held in an Orzhov vault or collecting sacrifices for a grand cer emony in the Raze-Boar's honor.

### Izzet League

![](/img/izzet-guildmage.jpg)

![](/img/izzet-electrodominance.jpg)

The lzzet are obsessive experimenters, combining a keen creative intellect with a short attention span. The original mandate of the Izzet guild was to provide solutions for public works projects (sewers. boilers, and roadways) but their increasingly far-fetched experiments satisfy only their insatiable curiosity. Sometimes their experiments yield useful technological advancements; other times they produce unintended mana geysers, spatial rifts, arcane portals, or huge explosions. All of which can be useful in their own way.

The league's most grandiose experiments typically concern public works projects and elemental experimentation. These efforts use a methodology that relies on unexpected outcomes: all results are informative, even if they completely defy expectations. For example, an experiment that begins as the creation of a "hypermana focusing lens~ might be renamed a "scram-range teleportal" once the researchers discover more properties of what they have fashioned. Then, after a few goblin volunteers vanish inside it, the apparatus gains the designation of "universal refuse disintegrator"- until the goblin volunteers are discovered alive, having been teleported far from the workshop. This sort of adjustment is par for the course in lzzet experiments: the "fiddle and find out" method is favored over any process of systematic scientific research.

The lzzet League is one of the few guilds whose founder, the dragon Niv-Mizzet, remains its guildmaster, just as the guild continues to fulfill its original mission (even as its experiments go far beyond the guild's original mandate).

#### Guildmaster - Niv-Mizzet

![](/img/izzet-niv-mizzet.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

Whatever your role in the lzzet League, you are expected to contribute to its research in some way. That contribution might involve participating in tests, whether as an assistant, a researcher, or a subject. You might be one of the soldiers who protects a laboratory, or a laborer responsible for lifting heavy pieces of equipment into place. Everyone's contribution matters, even if the Izzet know that some matter more than others.

### Orzhov Syndicate

![](/img/orzohov-1.jpg)

![](/img/orzohov-godless-shrine.jpg)

Wealth is power, and you absolutely can take it with you if you're an undying spirit living in decadent luxury on the ruling council of the Orzhov Syndicate. Built on the crushed dreams and broken bodies of citizens deeply indebted to the syndicate's banks and loan sharks, Orzhov's elaborate hierarchy of syndics, priests, and oligarchs exists for the single purpose of funneling wealth to the top. Beneath the twin facades of religious hierarchy and banking operation, Orzhov is an organized crime syndicate with its fingers in businesses across the city.

The Orzhov's original function was both religious and financial, with the two functions closely related. As Ravnica's dominant church, the Orzhov continues to preach an oppressive message that equates sin with debt and promises forgiveness to those who make tithes and donations. As Ravnica's principal bank, it stores and secures the riches of the city, collecting interest at high rates to expand its own wealth. Its members truly believe that their work is necessary to the proper functioning of Ravnica. Although most other Ravnicans see the Orzhov for the corrupt organization it is, many people are still dazzled by the syndicate's promises of wealth, prestige, and longevity.

The Ghost Council, also called the Obzedat, that leads the Orzhov founded the guild and signed the Guildpact, but it isn't clear which members of the original Obzedat might have faded from existence since then and which current members have joined since.

#### Guildmaster - Ghost Council - Obzedat

![](/img/orzohov-obzedat.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

The structure of the Orzhov Syndicate means that you are always doing the bidding of someone higher up the ladder than you are. Ultimately, your role in the guild is defined by whatever the people (and spirits) above you decide for you.

For most of your career, you can expect to engage in some aspect of the day-to-day criminal operations of the guild. That can mean throwing your weight around to enforce the will of the guild or using religious authority to extort offerings from the people. But it can also mean doing various errands for your superiors, from bearing messages to carrying out assassinations.

### Cult of Rakdos

![](/img/rakdos-judith-scourge-diva.jpg)

![](/img/rakdos-firewheeler.jpg)

Tomorrow is an illusion; every thing is ridiculous. Members of the Cult of Rakdos have witnessed the grandiose speeches and self-important plans of other guilds and concluded that their rivals take themselves far too seriously.

Since death comes for everyone, and since order tends inevitably toward chaos, the Rakdos believe that unrestrained, moment-to-moment hedonism is the only sane way to live. Of course, few other Ravnicans would describe the Rakdos as sane.

The Cult of Rakdos bears the name of the demon lord who founded it. As laid out in the Guildpact, the guild was intended to fill rol es concerning entertainment, mining, and manual labor. Some argue that any effort to give a demonic cult a respectable role in society was doomed to failure, but the cult remains part of Ravnica's social fabric nevertheless. The Guildpact prohibits the cult 's extermination, and its entertainments - even as dark and destructive as they are - hold broad appeal. From rowdy mobs who love to see the Rakdos skewer the powerful elites to decadent socialites who come to the Rakdos for illicit amusements, most of Ravnica's people don't really want the Rakdos to go away, as much as they might publicly protest otherwise.

#### Guildmaster - Rakdos

![](/img/rakdos-showstopper.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

The Cult of Rakdos encourages independent action on the part of its members. Its goal is fomenting chaos, and it firmly believes in putting its own house in disorder before carrying that mission into the larger city. So your role is to execute your vision of grand satire and disruptive performance art, as yo u aspire to outdo your guild mates and attract the attention of Rakdos himself. You work as part of a troupe, with your artistic talents used in service to a ringmaster's vision. But your performance is your own, and no one expects you to follow a script. In fact, if you go through a performance without doing something you haven't done before, you're clearly not trying hard enough.

### Selesnya Conclave

![](/img/selesnya-ledev-guardian.jpg)

![](/img/selesnya-conclave-tribunal.jpg)

Like a thriving garden, carefully tended and abundantly fertile, the communities of the Selesnya Conclave are a harmonious union of nature and civilization. The members of the conclave dream of embracing all of Ravnica in their peaceful union. In the meantime, they are growing an army, preparing to resist the ambition and destructive impulses of the other guilds and fight to defend their way of life.

At the heart of the Selesnya faith and philosophy is the Worldsoul, called Mat 'Selesnya, which its devotees believe to be a manifestation of nature itself. At the signing of the original Guildpact, Mat'Selesnya was embodied in an elemental form and acted as the guild's first guild master. The current guildmaster, Trostani, three dryads fused together with Mat'Selesnya into a single being- is said to embody the will of the Worldsoul.

#### Guildmaster - Trostani

![](/img/selesnya-trostani.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

Although the guild teaches the importance of subjugating the individual will to the good of the conclave, it also celebrates the diversity of individuals, in the same sense that a field that produces different crops is healthier than one that yields a single crop. That principle applies to your skill as an adventurer. As long as your efforts are directed toward advancing the goals of the guild rather than your private agenda, you're allowed to put your talents to work in your unique way.

That said, you must never lose sight of the fact that you are part of a larger comm unity. That includes the whole guild, of course, but your ties to community start with your _Vernadi_ (enclave) and its _Vođa_ (dryad leader). The dryads want to know what you're doing and what purpose it serves, and they act to curtail your actions or even expel you from the guild - if they determine that you aren't serving Selesnya's best interests.

### Simic Combine

![](/img/simic-asc.jpg)

![](/img/simic-guardian-project.jpg)

The secrets of life are revealed in the laboratories of the Simic, and their research notes plumb and catalog nature's wonders. Their original mission was to oversee issues of public health, but the Simic came to believe that complete health of individuals and of society as a whole-depends on the mutual adaptation of nature and civilization to one another. Thus, biological experimentation has always been among its primary concerns.

Historically, the guild's approach to its mission has been one of incremental progress toward a utopian ideal of thriving biology, and it remains more aloof from politics than other guilds. Its fundamental mission remains unchanged by the current political instability, and the isolation of its laboratories protects most Simic guild members from immediate harm.

Little is known about the combine's founder, except that this individual's first or family name was Simic.

#### Guildmaster - Vannifer

![](/img/simic-vannifer.jpg)

#### How Do I Fit In?

As a Simic adventurer, your mission likely aligns with the Adaptationist philosophy; the disagreements and tensions among the guilds will soon erupt into open conflict, and your guild needs your help to ensure that the Simic survive. That help might come in the form of defending against Golgari incursions into Simic zonots or s hielding Simic research from Azorius intrusion. It could also involve more subtle, diplomatic work to maintain balance among the guilds, or subterfuge aimed at undermining another guild's grab for power.

Self-improvement is also a n important part of your mission. Anything you can do to make yourself more capable - whether learning a new spell or adopting a new hybridizing mutation - gives the Simic a stronger weapon in it's arsenal. The Combine must change to survive, and that means individual members of the guild must grow and adapt as well.
